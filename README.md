### ðŸ©ºINTRODUCTION
Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and prediction of diabetes can significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. In this report, we delve into a comprehensive analysis of a diabetes prediction dataset using Python. The dataset, named _diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv_ contains various features such as gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, BMI, HbA1c level, blood glucose level, and diabetes status. Our goal is to explore this dataset, clean it, and derive meaningful insights that can aid in predicting diabetes.

**Distribution of Key Features**
- **Age Distribution:** The age distribution is relatively uniform, with a slight peak around the 40s.
- **BMI Distribution:** The BMI values are normally distributed around the mean, indicating a healthy range for most individuals.
- **HbA1c and Blood Glucose Levels:** These features show a right-skewed distribution, suggesting that a majority of individuals have lower levels, with a few outliers having higher levels.

**Correlation Analysis**
A correlation matrix can help identify relationships between features. For instance, the numerical variables indicated no negative correlations among the features. The strongest correlation was observed between **Blood Glucose Level** and **Diabetes** at 0.42, followed by **HbA1c Level** and **Diabetes** at 0.40, and **BMI** and **Age** at 0.34. The weakest correlation was between **HbA1c Level** and **Age**, with a value of 0.10. Visualizing these correlations can provide deeper insights into the factors contributing to diabetes.

### ðŸ©ºDATA PREPROCESSING
During data preprocessing, categorical variables were encoded into numerical formats, the dataset was split into an 80% training set and a 20% testing set, and feature scaling was applied to normalize numerical variables. These steps ensured compatibility, accuracy, and a robust evaluation of the model's performance, establishing a solid foundation for reliable predictive modeling.

1. **Splitting the Data:** The dataset was split into training and testing sets (80-20 split) to evaluate the performance of predictive models.
  
2. **Gender:** Encoded gender into numerical values (Female: 0, Male: 1) for machine learning models.
  
3. **Smoking History:** Encoded smoking history into numerical categories (never: 0, current: 1, former: 2, ever: 3, not current: 4).
